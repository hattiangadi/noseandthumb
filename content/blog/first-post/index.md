# Neither Bloody nor Bowed

They say of me, and so they should,\
It's doubtful if I come to good.\
I see acquaintances and friends\
Accumulating dividends,\
And making enviable names\
In science, art, and parlor games.\
But I, despite expert advice,\
Keep doing things I think are nice,\
And though to good I never come-\
Inseparable my nose and thumb!
