I'm a devoted generalist - this blog is my space to ruminate about a variety of subjects. 

> #### Neither Bloody nor Bowed
> They say of me, and so they should,\
> It's doubtful if I come to good.\
> I see acquaintances and friends\
> Accumulating dividends,\
> And making enviable names\
> In science, art, and parlor games.\
> But I, despite expert advice,\
> Keep doing things I think are nice,\
> And though to good I never come-\
> Inseparable my nose and thumb!
