The grilled cheese sandwich - bread with a toasty crunch contrasting with the melted softness of the cheese. Enhance the cheese with some tomato for a meaty glutamate punch and add some juiciness to the melt in the middle. \
For todays lunch I remembered the street grilled cheese sandwiches in Mumbai - mild Amul cheese with tomatoes and spiked with green chutney. Except - we had these great figs from our new tree in a pot on our patio - so those came in for the tomatoes. Jarlsberg cheese replaced the Amul, sourdough for the sandwich white... OK, so this was nothing like the Mumbai sandwich. But it was good!
